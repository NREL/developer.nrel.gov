  title: EVI-Pro Lite API
  description: |-
    APIs providing output from NREL's EVI-Pro model. Used to power the EVI-Pro Lite tool at https://afdc.energy.gov/evi-pro-lite. These endpoints provide daily (24 hour) fleet-level charging load profiles for a variety of customizable scenarios.

    EVI-Pro Lite is a simplified version of the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Projection Tool (EVI-Pro). EVI-Pro uses real-world travel data from mass market consumers to estimate future requirements for residential, workplace, and public charging under a variety of scenarios. For more information regarding EVI-Pro Lite, see the [methodology and assumptions page](https://afdc.energy.gov/evi-pro-lite/load-profile/assumptions).

    While the EVI-Pro Lite API generates 24-hr load profiles for representative weekdays and weekends, some users may find it helpful to concatenate daily profiles into an annual profile. To facilitate this process, considering leveraging this Python script available on <a href="https://github.com/NREL/EVI-Pro-Lite">GitHub</a>.

      - "Daily Load Profiles"
      summary: Loads (kW) are returned in 15-min step intervals for 24 hours where the 15-min data point is the average of instantaneous load over that interval. The first element of the load profile covers 12:00 AM - 12:15 AM, the second 12:15 AM - 12:30 AM, and so on.
