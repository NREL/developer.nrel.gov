<p>Collect and download, as CSV, a configurable set of solar and meteorological data fields from The NSRDB. The National Solar Radiation Database <a href="https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/">(NSRDB)</a> is a serially complete collection of satellite-derived measurements of solar radiation—global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance—and meteorological data. These data have been collected at a sufficient number of locations and temporal and spatial scales to accurately represent regional solar radiation climates. The data are publicly available at no cost to the user. These API provide access to downloading the data. Other options are detailed <a href="https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/data-sets/download-instructions.html">here</a>. Read more about the datasets at <a href="https://nsrdb.nrel.gov">https://nsrdb.nrel.gov</a>.</p>

        A well-known text (WKT) representation of the geometry for which to extract data. May be a point, multipoint, or polygon geometry. When a point is passed the site nearest to that point is used. When a multipoint is passed the site nearest each point is used. This can be useful for downloading multiple sites in a single request when those sites are geographically distant from each other. When a polygon is passed all sites that intersect with the given polygon are used.

<h2 id="rate-limits">Rate Limits</h2>

<p>Rate limits for this application are significantly less than the <a href="/docs/rate-limits" target="_blank">standard rate limits</a> for developer.nrel.gov. This decrease in the limit is required as the data provided through this service is significantly more computationally intensive to generate and provide. These rate limits are carefully calculated to allow all users the maximum throughput that our servers can sustain.</p>

<p>There are several levels of rate limiting for this service. The first limit determines how many requests a given user can make per 24 hour period. For requests utilizing the <em>.csv</em> format this rate limit is set at 5000 a day at a frequency of no more than 1 per second. For all other requests this limit is set at 1000 requests per day at a frequency of no more than 1 every 2 seconds.</p>

<p>Secondly each user is limited to 20 in-flight requests at any given time.</p>

<p>In addition, the service has a fail-safe mechanism to prevent significant performance decreases that can be caused by unexpectedly high usage of the service. This limit will cause the service to stop accepting requests when the queue reaches a point where additional requests will significantly lower server performance. When this limit is hit, the service will error with a message describing that the request queue is full.</p>
