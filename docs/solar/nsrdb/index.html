<p>Freely available downloads of The National Solar Radiation Database.</p>

<p>The National Solar Radiation Database <a href="https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/">(NSRDB)</a> is a serially complete collection of meteorological and solar irradiance data sets for the United States and a growing list of international locations. The data are publicly available at no cost to the user. These API provide access to downloading the data. Other options are detailed <a href="https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/download-instructions">here</a></p>

<a href="/docs/solar/nsrdb/himawari-download/">Himawari: PSM v3 Download</a>

<span class="url">(/api/nsrdb/v2/solar/himawari-download)</span>


</h3>

<p>The Himawari based solar resource data uses the Physical Solar Model version 3 (PSM v3) which is similar to the model used in the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) The Himawari: PSM v3 provides a serially complete collection of 15 minute values of the three most common measurements of solar radiation—global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance—and meteorological data at a 2 km resolution. The data is available for all locations covered by the Himawari satellite.</p>

<p>The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is a serially complete collection of satellite-derived measurements of solar radiation—global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance—and meteorological data. These data have been collected at a sufficient number of locations and temporal and spatial scales to accurately represent regional solar radiation climates.</p>

<a href="/docs/solar/nsrdb/full-disc-download/">NSRDB Full Disc</a>

<span class="url">(/api/nsrdb/v2/solar/full-disc-download)</span>


</h3>

<p>This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of 0.02 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or nominally 2 km in size. The solar radiation values represent the resource available to solar energy systems. The data was created using cloud properties which are generated using the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x) algorithms. Fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) in conjunction with the cloud properties, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from ancillary source are used to estimate DNI and GHI. The direct normal irradiance (DNI) and GHI are computed for clear skies using the REST2 model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, the FARMS is used to compute the GHI. The DNI for cloud scenes is then computed using the DISC model.</p>

<p>Collect and download, as CSV, a configurable set of solar and meteorological data fields from The NSRDB. This API is capable of creating very large downloadable archives. Unlike a typical API, the response to this provides a request acknowledgement. The real work of creating the requested downloadable archive will continue to run on the server side. When complete, and email will be sent to the email address provided in the initial request with either a link to a file to download, or in the case of a very, very large archive, a link to more detailed instructions for using Globus to complete the download. In addition to this two step workflow, there is also an option for users who wish to download a single CSV file in direct response to an API request. The <em>.csv</em> format may be used to download a CSV directly. This feature is restricted to use with only a single POINT, for a single YEAR at a time.<br />Read more about the datasets at <a href="https://nsrdb.nrel.gov">https://nsrdb.nrel.gov</a></p>
