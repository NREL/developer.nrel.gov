<p>Freely available downloads of Wind Integration National Dataset Toolkit.</p>

<p>The Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) Toolkit is an update and expansion of the Eastern Integration Data Set and Western Wind Integration Data Set. It supports the next generation of wind integration studies. The WIND Toolkit includes meteorological conditions and turbine power for more than 126,000 sites in the continental United States for the years 2007â€”2013.

<p>Collect and download, as CSV, a configurable set of data fields from a multi-national collection of wind stations. This data represents wind-speed, temperature, and direction values at 80m, 100m, and 120m above the surface and air pressure at the surface, 100m, and 200m above the surface for the year 2015 produced using WRF v3.7. The model time resolution used was 15 minutes with a nominal spatial resolution of 3 km2 over Kazakhstan and 9 km2 over the surrounding region. For the U and V components used to derive the wind speed, a total of 41 pressure levels were used.</p>
