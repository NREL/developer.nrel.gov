The National Climate Database (NCDB) is a high-resolution, bias-corrected climate dataset including global horizontal irradiance, direct normal irradiance, and diffuse horizontal irradiance, as well as other meteorological data. Currently, the NCDB covers the contiguous United States and provides 4-km and hourly resolution climate projections under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the years from 2006-2100. The data are publicly available at no cost to the user. These API provide access to downloading the data. Other options are detailed [here](https://climate.nrel.gov/data-sets/how-to-access-data)
