title: Spectral Data On-demand
summary: "The spectral on-demand data service provides solar irradiances on inclined PV panels for 2002 narrow-wavelength bands from 0.28 to 4.0 µm. Based on users’ selection of location, time period, and PV system (fixed or one-axis PV system), a dedicated high-performance server located at NREL computes the spectral data in real time using the Fast All-sky Radiation Model for Solar applications with Narrowband Irradiances on Tilted surfaces (FARMS-NIT) and broadband and ancillary data served by the NSRDB. FARMS-NIT is an innovative radiative transfer model developed at NREL to efficiently and simultaneously calculate the spatial distribution of solar energy (radiances) in narrow-wavelength bands which are integrated over inclined PV panels to infer the plane-of-array (POA) irradiances."
detail: This API is capable of creating very large downloadable archives. Unlike a typical API, the response to this provides a request acknowledgement. The real work of creating the requested downloadable archive will continue to run on the server side. When complete, and email will be sent to the email address provided in the initial request with a link to a file to download.

<h2 id="rate-limits">Rate Limits</h2>

Rate limits for this application are significantly less than the [standard rate limits](/docs/rate-limits){:target="_blank"} for developer.nrel.gov. This decrease in the limit is required because the data provided through this service is very computationally intensive to generate and provide. These rate limits are carefully calculated to allow all users the maximum throughput that our servers can sustain.

There are several levels of rate limiting for this service. The first limit determines how many requests a given user can make per 24 hour period. For all requests this limit is set at 1000 requests per day at a frequency of no more than 1 every 2 seconds.

Secondly each user is limited to 20 in-flight requests at any given time.

In addition to this limit, the service has a secondary fail-safe mechanism designed to prevent significant performance decreases that can be caused by unexpectedly high usage of the service. This limit will cause the service to stop accepting requests when the queue reaches a point where additional requests will significantly lower server performance. When this limit is hit, the service will error with a message describing that the request queue is full.
