The National Solar Radiation Database [(NSRDB)](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/) is a serially complete collection of satellite-derived measurements of solar radiation—global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance—and meteorological data. These data have been collected at a sufficient number of locations and temporal and spatial scales to accurately represent regional solar radiation climates. The data are publicly available at no cost to the user. These API provide access to downloading the data. Other options are detailed [here](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/data-sets/how-to-access-data)
