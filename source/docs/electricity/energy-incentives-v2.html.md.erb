      "summary": "<p><strong><i>Note: <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-15-12.pdf\">IRS Notice 2015-12</a> announced the availability of close to $1.4 billion in remaining volume cap for New CREBs. On March 5, 2015, the IRS opened the rolling volume-cap application window for governmental bodies and cooperative utilities, as well as a closed-end application period for public power providers.    <br/>&#10;<br/>&#10;Readers should also note that the terms &#34;New&#34; and &#34;Old&#34;  CREBs are used in the following summary to distinguish between prior CREB allocations and the New CREB authorizations made by the U.S. Congress in 2008 and 2009.  The use of the term &#34;New CREBs&#34; has legal significance in that New CREBs authorized under 26 USC § 54A and 54C have substantially different rules than prior CREB allocations authorized under 26 USC § 54. </i></strong> <br/>&#10;<br/>&#10;Clean renewable energy bonds (CREBs) may be used by certain entities -- primarily in the public sector -- to finance renewable energy projects.  The list of qualifying technologies is generally the same as that used for the federal renewable energy production tax credit (PTC). CREBs may be issued by electric cooperatives, government entities (states, cities, counties, territories, Indian tribal governments or any political subdivision thereof), and by certain lenders.  The bondholder receives federal tax credits in lieu of a portion of the traditional bond interest, resulting in a lower effective interest rate for the borrower.* The issuer remains responsible for repaying the principal on the bond.<br/>&#10;<br/>&#10;The <a title=\"See legislation\" href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.1424.enr:\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"summarylink\">Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 (Div. A, Sec. 107)</a> allocated $800 million for new Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs). In February 2009, the <a title=\"Go to legislation\" href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/home/h1/Recovery_Bill_Div_B.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"See legislation\">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Div. B, Sec. 1111)</a> allocated an additional $1.6 billion for New CREBs, for a total New CREB allocation of $2.4 billion. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 also extended the deadline for previously reserved allocations (&#34;Old CREBs&#34;) until December 31, 2009, and addressed several provisions in the existing law that previously limited the usefulness of the program for some projects. A separate section of the law extended CREBs eligibility to marine energy and hydrokinetic power projects.<br/>&#10;<br/>&#10;Participation in the program is limited by the volume of bonds allocated by Congress for the program.  Participants must first apply to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for a CREBs allocation, and then issue the bonds within a specified time period. The New CREBs allocation totaling $2.4 billion does not have a defined expiration date under the law; however, recent IRS solicitations for new applications require the bonds to be issued within 3 years after the applicant receives notification of an approved allocation (see History section below for information on previous allocations). Public power providers, governmental bodies, and electric cooperatives are each reserved an equal share (33.3%) of the New CREBs allocation. IRS Notice 2015-12, however, divided the remaining volume cap differently: $516,565,691.35 for public power providers, $597,134,963.60 for governmental bodies, and $280,778,469.00 for cooperative utilities.</p><p>The tax credit rate is set daily by the U.S. Treasury Department.  Under past allocations, the credit could be taken quarterly on a dollar-for-dollar basis to offset the tax liability of the bondholder. However, under the new CREBs allocation, the credit has been reduced to 70% of what it would have been otherwise.  Other important changes are described in IRS Notice 2009-33.<br/>&#10;<br/>&#10;CREBs differ from traditional tax-exempt bonds in that the tax credits issued through CREBs are treated as taxable income for the bondholder. The tax credit may be taken each year the bondholder has a tax liability as long as the credit amount does not exceed the limits established by the federal <i>Energy Policy Act of 2005</i>. Treasury rates for prior CREB allocations, or &#34;Old&#34; CREBs are available <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/GA-SL/SLGS/selectCREBDate.htm\" title=\"Old CREB rates\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"summarylink\">here</a>, while rates for New CREBs and other qualified tax credit bonds are available <a href=\"https://www.treasurydirect.gov/GA-SL/SLGS/selectQTCDate.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New CREB rates\" class=\"summarylink\">here</a>. <br/>&#10;<br/>&#10;In April 2009, the IRS issued Notice 2009-33, which solicited applications for the New CREB allocation and provided interim guidance on certain program rules and changes from prior CREB allocations. The expiration date for New CREB applications under this solicitation was August 4, 2009.  Further guidance on CREBs is available in IRS Notices 2006-7 and 2007-26 to the extent that the program rules were not modified by 2008 and 2009 legislation. In October 2009, the Department of Treasury <a title=\"CREB allocation list\" href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/ncrebs_2009_allocations_v1.1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"summarylink\">announced</a> the allocation of $2.2 billion in new CREBs for 805 projects across the country. A new solicitation (IRS Announcement 2010-54) was issued in September 2010 for roughly $191 million in unallocated New CREB bond volume available only to electric cooperatives. The award announcement for this allocation was made in March 2011. It remains to be seen if or when the IRS will issue new funding announcements for Old CREB allocations which were not issued by the December 31, 2009 deadline, or New CREB allocations which miss the three-year issuance period. <br/>&#10;<br/>&#10;<b>History</b> <br/>&#10;The federal <i>Energy Policy Act of 2005</i> (EPAct 2005) established Clean Energy Renewable Bonds (CREBs) as a financing mechanism for public sector renewable energy projects. This legislation originally allocated $800 million of tax credit bonds to be issued between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007. Following the enactment of the federal <i>Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006</i>, the IRS made an additional $400 million in CREBs financing available for 2008 through Notice 2007-26. <br/>&#10;<br/>&#10;In November 2006, the IRS announced that the original $800 million allocation had been reserved for a total of 610 projects.  The additional $400 million (plus surrendered volume from the previous allocation) was allocated to 312 projects in February 2008.  Of the $1.2 billion total of tax-credit bond volume cap allocated to fund renewable-energy projects, state and local government borrowers were limited to $750 million of the volume cap, with the rest reserved for qualified municipal or cooperative electric companies.<br/>&#10;<br/>&#10;For further information on CREBs, contact Zoran Stojanovic or Timothy Jones of the IRS Office of Associate Chief Counsel at (202) 622-3980.  Questions on recent IRS Notice 2009-33 can be directed to Janae Lemley at (636) 255-1202.<br/>&#10;<i><br/>&#10;<br/>&#10;*In March 2010 Congress enacted <a title=\"See legislation\" href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.2847.ENR:\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"summarylink\">H.R. 2847 (Sec. 301)</a> permitting New CREB issuers to make an irrevocable election to receive a direct payment -- a refundable tax credit -- from the Department of Treasury equivalent to and in lieu of the amount of the non-refundable tax credit which would otherwise be provided to the bondholder. This option only applies to New CREBs issued after the March 18, 2010 enactment of the law.

Similar to its predecessor, the REAP promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy for agricultural producers and rural small businesses through the use of (1) grants and loan guarantees for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems, and (2) grants for energy audits and renewable energy development assistance. Congress has allocated funding for the new program in the following amounts: $55 million for FY 2009, $60 million for FY 2010, $70 million for FY 2011, and $70 million for FY 2012. REAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). In addition to these mandatory funding levels, up to $25 million in discretionary funding may be issued each year. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (H.R. 8) extended discretionary funding for FY 2013. The 2014 Farm Bill reauthorized the USDA to offer these programs and removed the mandate to offer grants for feasibility studies.<br/>&#10;&#9;<br/>&#10;&#9;<em>* The Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program was created by the USDA pursuant to Section 9006 of the 2002 federal</em> <em>Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002</em>. <em>Funding in the amount of $23 million per year was appropriated for each fiscal year from FY 2003-2007. In March 2008, the USDA announced that it would accept $220.9 million in applications for grants, loan guarantees, and loan/grant combination packages under the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program. The application deadline was June 16, 2008.<br/>&#10;&#9;<br/>&#10;&#9;**Land grant colleges and universities are referred to above as &#34;schools&#34; and &#34;institutions&#34;.

These standards made revisions to those promulgated by FERC in May 2005 through its Order 2006. <span>The FERC's standards apply only to facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the commission; these facilities mostly include those that interconnect at the transmission level. Given that purely intra-state distribution grids are generally considered to not be in &#34;interstate commerce&#34;, the FERC's standards generally do not apply to distribution-level interconnection, which is regulated by state public utilities commissions.

Small wind turbines must now meet the performance and quality standards set forth by either the American Wind Energy Association Small Wind Turbine Performance and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Safety Standard 9.1-2009 (AWEA), or  the International Electrotechnical Commission 61400-1, 61400-12, and 61400-11 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;(IEC)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;span&gt;The federal business energy investment tax credit available under 26 USC § 48 was expanded significantly by the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 (H.R. 1424), enacted in October 2008. This law extended the duration -- by eight years -- of the existing credits for solar energy, fuel cells and microturbines; increased the credit amount for fuel cells; established new credits for small wind-energy systems, geothermal heat pumps, and combined heat and power (CHP) systems; allowed utilities to use the credits; and allowed taxpayers to take the credit against the alternative minimum tax (AMT), subject to certain limitations. The credit was further expanded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, enacted in February 2009.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#10;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;In general, the following credits are available for eligible systems placed in service on or before December 31, 2016*:&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#10;&lt;ul&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&lt;b&gt;Solar.&lt;/b&gt; The credit is equal to 30% of expenditures, with no maximum credit. Eligible solar energy property includes equipment that uses solar energy to generate electricity, to heat or cool (or provide hot water for use in) a structure, or to provide solar process heat. Hybrid solar lighting systems, which use solar energy to illuminate the inside of a structure using fiber-optic distributed sunlight, are eligible. Passive solar systems and solar pool-heating systems are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; eligible.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&lt;b&gt;Fuel Cells.&lt;/b&gt; The credit is equal to 30% of expenditures, with no maximum credit. However, the credit for fuel cells is capped at $1,500 per 0.5 kilowatt (kW) of capacity. Eligible property includes fuel cells with a minimum capacity of 0.5 kW that have an electricity-only generation efficiency of 30% or higher. (Note that the credit for property placed in service before October 4, 2008, is capped at $500 per 0.5 kW.)&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&lt;b&gt;Small Wind Turbines.&lt;/b&gt; The credit is equal to 30% of expenditures, with no maximum credit for small wind turbines placed in service after December 31, 2008. Eligible small wind property includes wind turbines up to 100 kW in capacity. (In general, the maximum credit is $4,000 for eligible property placed in service after October 3, 2008, and before January 1, 2009. &lt;i&gt;The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009&lt;/i&gt; removed the $4,000 maximum credit limit for small wind turbines.) Small wind turbines must meet the performance and quality standards set forth by either the American Wind Energy Association Small Wind Turbine Performance and Safety Standard 9.1-2009 (AWEA), or  the International Electrotechnical Commission 61400-1, 61400-12, and 61400-11 (IEC)&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&lt;b&gt;Geothermal Systems.&lt;/b&gt; The credit is equal to 10% of expenditures, with no maximum credit limit stated. Eligible geothermal energy property includes geothermal heat pumps and equipment used to produce, distribute or use energy derived from a geothermal deposit. For electricity produced by geothermal power, equipment qualifies only up to, but not including, the electric transmission stage. For geothermal heat pumps, this credit applies to eligible property placed in service after October 3, 2008. Note that the credit for geothermal property, with the exception of geothermal heat pumps, has no stated expiration date.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&lt;b&gt;Microturbines.&lt;/b&gt; The credit is equal to 10% of expenditures, with no maximum credit limit stated (explicitly). The credit for microturbines is capped at $200 per kW of capacity. Eligible property includes microturbines up to two megawatts (MW) in capacity that have an electricity-only generation efficiency of 26% or higher.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;li&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&amp;#9;&lt;b&gt;Combined Heat and Power (CHP).&lt;/b&gt; The credit is equal to 10% of expenditures, with no maximum limit stated. Eligible CHP property generally includes systems up to 50 MW in capacity that exceed 60% energy efficiency, subject to certain limitations and reductions for large systems. The efficiency requirement does not apply to CHP systems that use biomass for at least 90% of the system's energy source, but the credit may be reduced for less-efficient systems. This credit applies to eligible property placed in service after October 3, 2008.&lt;/li&gt;&amp;#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;#10;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;In general, the original use of the equipment must begin with the taxpayer, or the system must be constructed by the taxpayer. The equipment must also meet any performance and quality standards in effect at the time the equipment is acquired. The energy property must be operational in the year in which the credit is first taken.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;Significantly, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 repealed a previous restriction on the use of the credit for eligible projects also supported by &amp;#34;subsidized energy financing.&amp;#34; For projects placed in service after December 31, 2008, this limitation no longer applies. Businesses that receive other incentives are advised to consult with a tax professional regarding how to calculate this federal tax credit.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9;&lt;span&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;A number of changes to this credit are scheduled to take effect for systems placed in service after December 31, 2016. The credit for equipment that uses solar energy to generate electricity, to heat or cool (or provide hot water for use in) a structure, or to provide solar process heat will decrease from 30% to 10%. The credit for geothermal heat pumps, hybrid solar lighting, small wind, fuel cells, microturbines, and combined heat and power systems will expire. The credit amount for equipment which uses geothermal energy to produce electricity will remain at 10%. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#10;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#10;&amp;#9; &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <program-name>Residential Energy Conservation Subsidy Exclusion (Personal)</program-name>
        <summary>&lt;p&gt;
          According to Section 136 of the U.S. Code, energy conservation subsidies provided (directly or indirectly) to customers by public utilities* are non-taxable. This exclusion does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; apply to electricity-generating systems registered as &amp;quot;qualifying facilities&amp;quot; under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). If a taxpayer claims federal tax credits or deductions for the energy conservation property, the investment basis for the purpose of claiming the deduction or tax credit must be reduced by the value of the energy conservation subsidy (i.e., a taxpayer may not claim a tax credit for an expense that the taxpayer ultimately did not pay).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          The term &amp;quot;energy conservation measure&amp;quot; includes installations or modifications primarily designed to reduce consumption of electricity or natural gas, or to improve the management of energy demand. Eligible dwelling units include houses, apartments, condominiums, mobile homes, boats and similar properties. If a building or structure contains both dwelling units and other units, any subsidy must be properly allocated.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          The definition of &amp;quot;energy conservation measure&amp;quot; implies that utility rebates for residential solar-thermal projects and photovoltaic (PV) systems may be non-taxable. However, the IRS has not ruled definitively on this issue. Taxpayers considering using this provision for a renewable energy system should discuss the details of the project with a tax professional. Other types of utility subsidies that may come in the form of credits or reduced rates might also be non-taxable, according to IRS Publication 525.&lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;

          * &lt;i&gt;The term &amp;quot;public utility&amp;quot; is defined as an entity &amp;quot;engaged in the sale of electricity or natural gas to residential, commercial, or industrial customers for use by such customers.&amp;quot; The term includes federal, state and local government entities.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
