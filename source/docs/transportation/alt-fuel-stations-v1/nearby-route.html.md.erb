title: Stations Nearby Route
summary: Find alternative fuel stations within a distance of a driving route.
url: GET|POST /api/alt-fuel-stations/v1/nearby-route

# <%= current_page.data.title %> <span class="url">(<%= current_page.data.url %>)</span>
<%= current_page.data.summary %> This dataset powers the <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/stations/">Alternative Fueling Station Locator</a> on the Alternative Fuels Data Center.

Driving directions and route generation are not provided by this service. You must first determine your route and then pass this service a representation of that route as a line (a series of latitude and longitude points).

## Request URL

<pre>GET|POST /api/alt-fuel-stations/v1/nearby-route<em>.format?parameters</em></pre>

*Note:* This API endpoint can be accessed via either `GET` or `POST`. `POST` may be necessary if sending a long `route` parameter that exceeds the allowed URL length limit. When using `POST`, the parameters should be sent to the API in the body using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding.

## Request Parameters

The following query parameters may be passed in the request to control the output:
